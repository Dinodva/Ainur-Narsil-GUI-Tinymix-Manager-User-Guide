# Ainur-Narsil-GUI-Tinymix-Manager-User-Guide
It is not exactly correct to say that Tinymix Manager is the GUI for Ainur Narsil audio mod, since it does not inerract directly. But as the matter of fact, Ainur Narsil has Tinymix binary built in and try to use some of its functions, as it can be seen from here: https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/ainur_narsil/blob/master/service.sh More correct would be say that Ainur Narsil removes all audio fx, and Tinymix on top of it allows modify some system audio settings, in such way extending its functionality without lowering quality. So we have not only system level audio settings unobstructed, but also can further improve them, which is not possible by any other means. Installing other popular audio mods here is not solution, for it brings us back to from where we have started, to pcm 16 bit. I have tested many audio players and most of Magisk audio mods with Flingerdamp.apk, and have found that where ever we enable them or equalisers built into media player, the sound becomes encoded into pcm 16bit. That is why, I use simplest media player, which is one built into Mixplorer.

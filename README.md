# Ainur-Narsil-GUI-Tinymix-Manager-User-Guide
It is not exactly correct to say that Tinymix Manager is the GUI for Ainur Narsil audio mod, since it does not interacting with the app itself directly. But as the matter of fact, Ainur Narsil has Tinymix binary built in and try to use some of its functions, as it can be seen from [here.](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/ainur_narsil/blob/master/service.sh)  More correct would be say that Ainur Narsil removes all audio fx and opens under-surface audio interface functionality, and Tinymix on top of it allows modify some hidden system audio settings, in such way extending the functionality of Ainur Narsil without lowering analog audio quality towards digital pcm16bit format in any way. So we have not only system level audio settings unobstructed, but also can further tweak them, which is not possible by any other means. Installing other popular audio mods here is not solution, for it brings us back to the point from where we have started, to pcm 16 bit audio format. I have tested many audio players (nearly half not even support analog playback in any way) and most of Magisk audio mods with Flingerdamp.apk, and have found that where ever we switch mods on or start to use equalizers built into media players, the sound immediately becomes encoded into pcm 16bit. That is why, I prefer to use simplest media player, without equalizer or any other tweaks, which is one built into Mixplorer, and which allows to listen music file as it is, without digital re-compression to pcm. Although this is the mater of individual taste.
## Qualcomm Audio 
[Qualcomm Audio](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/internet-of-things/consumer/audio)  [(link 2)](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/internet-of-things/consumer/audio/mobile-audio) is integrated into core of the Qualcomm processors, but its full potential usually not properly implemented by Android developers and manufacturers due various reasons, such as licensing, personal interests, the safety of equipment (i.e. speakers & headphones), as well as safety of ears (which also could cost). That is why, as I have found, for example the HD mode for head phones wasn't activated by default on my Redmi 7, or Hifi sound was not activated by default on my Pixel 3, even after installing Ainur Narsil. 
## Audio Modifications
On older versions of Android, we could relatively easily edit values of mixer_path.xml, in accordance with our demands, but the newer versions of android made this process much more difficult. I have spent lot of time trying to make my system partition r/w, and have to reinstall OS anew after this, but was not able to implement properly working solution (without causing much stress) on A12 stock+microg. And here Tinymix Manager comes to help. With the help of this program we can change different audio setting on analog level easily. The most changes would survive till the next reboot, while some tweaks we have to enable while listening music, such as for example 'enable compression of gapless playback on-off'. Also potentially and probably for now, using the combination of Ainur Narsil+Tinymix, we can change those values permanently. This function is not tested much by me yet, but I will describe how to test and use it below.
## What is Tinymix?
Tinymix and Tinyalsa are the audio implementing components of Linux OS, borrowed by android developers along with other inbuilt components of Linux. In older versions of Android, approximately up to A9, the tinymix binaries were included as mandatory, but later they were abolished as obsolete by developers, who went other way, and never bother to properly implement their functionality into AOS. Instead of implementing dynamic functions of tinymix, developers have chosen to replace its function by static mixer_path.xml. Despite this sad fact, tinymix is still remains functional, but requires tinymix binaries along with GUI to function properly. And so far, it is the only working solution among many tasted by me, to modify mixer path values without actually modifying it, which is the Tinymix Manager app.
## Requirements
I have tasted Tinymix Manager on Android 9-10, Lineage OS Microg  edition  Redmi7 and Stock A12 with Microg on Pixel 3. In both causes it was working properly. And both are Qualcomm devices. Since MTK devises may have different audio implementation (never bothered to check up or not remember), I doubt that Tinymix Manager could work properly on non Qualcomm devices. Also, I doubt Exinos devices. Both tested rooms have signature spoofing enabled, but I do not think it requires for it to work properly. Magisk versions 20 to 27. And in cause if you decide to go for Magisk Module installation of the Tinymix Manager as the system program, it is desirable to have custom recovery installed in cause of any problems.
## Implementation:
There are tree possible installations of Tinymix: first original apk with less permissions. This version available in three formats: arm7, arm8 and x86. Second is modified by me apk, which is only for arm8. My mod has more audio and system related permissions (I only edited manifest.xml). Note: the both above mentioned apks are very primitive, and have only functionality related to tinymix.bin and audio flinger lib.so (built in). They didn't have internet access on any level. The third possible implementation is to install Tinymix Manager as system app via provided by me Magisk module, in cause if you were not satisfied with both above mentioned solutions. I personally use this method, actually I have assembled this module for myself.
## Installation

***Install as apk:***   first flash Ainur Narsil via Magisk and reboot. Then install Tinymix Manager apk of your choice as regular apk. Open it and enable super user rights for the app when you would be prompted. If opened window of apk blank, it means that you don't have Tinymix binaries in your system. In such case, you have to flash Tinymix Binaries Installer Magisk module and reboot. After this you can use the app to change different values of audio settings of inbuilt android mixer. If original version with less permissions doesn't worked for you then try modified version. 
***Install as Magisk module:*** This is more risky setup and I wouldn't recommend you to do this if you don't have custom recovery installed. I recommend make clear install on fresh rom, without AML or any audio modules. Otherwise it could potentially mess up all around. I have tried two installation methods, one with Ainur Narsil first, and other with Ainur Narsil on top of Tinymix. The second method I have tried, desiring to see, if I could get the same performance without Ainur Narsil. The results were unsatisfactory, therefore I flashed AN on top of TM. The second method was working for me better, since after it, I have 'hifi mode on' and headphones set to 'hifi AB' on permanent basis, which survive through numerous reboots. Hope this wouldn't upset battery much. To be honest, I was much surprised to see this happen. I was listening music with these options enabled in Tinymix Manager and then I flashed Ainur Narsil above it, without changing them back. And since then for many reboots these values remain unchanged, while few others I still have to change manually each reboot.  I did not tasted this method with other settings for second time, for I have tied from starting from 'zero point' and for now have no time left, but there are chances that it may work also for you. That is speculation so far: I am still not sure 100%, but probably and potentially Ainur Narsil could be used as well as 'fixer' of values set in Tinymix before flashing it. Note: in first install without permanent changes, I have used AN last version of 2022. In second time I used AN mod of 2023. But I do not think that difference of versions have caused this permanent change of values. Also, value 'hifi function on' is not found in the mixer path xml.
***How to:*** *Method 1:* This method is less complicated and troublesome then second. First install Ainur Narsil Magisk Module of your choice (2022 or 2023) and reboot device. Then install Tinymix Manager Installer Magisk module (there two versions with old and new templates) and reboot device. Binaries, permission and audio flinger are inbuilt into the module, so no need in separate flashing of binaries module. If you have it installed then remove and reboot before install. Then check if your media player correctly works after this. If there is no sound, while playing mp3 or m4a then reinstall media player again. If there is still not sound, then install apk from module (open it as archive) on top of it and reboot. If there still no sound, then reinstall media player again. You can also try to clear cache via recovery. Now it should work for you or at least it is worked for me. If you are planing to install more audio mods then you have to install Audio Modification Library on top of this setup. ***Note:*** after installing AML there are chances that sound of media player may disappear again. To make it work repeat the steps mentioned above. 
***The Method Two*** is similar in details, but first you have change the values you want to keep as permanent in Tinymix Manager. Then flash AN and AML as described above. It is took few more reinstalls and reboots to make this setup working properly.
## Troubleshooting:
There few problems you may encounter, few of which were described above, which is loosing sound in audio playback. Note: video playback was always OK, despite any changes. While using Tinymix,   I have found that adding some controls to favorites may make your favorites window grey-out with all values disappearing (as for example hifi function on off). In such cause just remove those values from favorites and all would return back. It is duty this reason that I went from apk to Magisk module, while probably apk could do the same work without that much complexity and risk. I did not tested this properly. So please do not repeat my mistake, this graying out happens with Magisk module installation as well.  If apk is works for you, then just use it and not go for Magisk version. So far, I have tried only old Magisk Module, I have assembled 3 years ago. With this module, there was no any problem with installation, but I have caught bootloop after I have uninstalled it. I came out of it by rebooting into recovery, flashing module again and clearing cache. Please be aware of this potential problem. I will make new module, which is based on new template, but I didn't tasted it, only tested template's install-uninstall with other apps inbuilt.

## Which Settings Could be Changed via TM?
Certainly this aps has its advantages and limitations. With my new version of mixer path (Pixel 3 with dedicated sound card), Tinymix Manager have  2972 controls, not all of which cold be changed, and only few of them are practically useful. In comparison my Redmi 7 (no sound card) has 2802 controls, many of which are different from Pixel 3.  In such way, Redmi 7 has only one HD mode for headphone (on off), while Pixel 3 has 7 modes, few of which are HIFI. Similarly, in dependence on you mobile hardware and mixer path, your device may have more or less controls appearing in Tinymix Manager.

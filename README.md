# Ainur-Narsil-GUI-Tinymix-Manager-User-Guide
It is not exactly correct to say that Tinymix Manager is the GUI for Ainur Narsil audio mod, since it does not interacting with it directly. But as the matter of fact, Ainur Narsil has Tinymix binary built in and try to use some of its functions, as it can be seen from [here.](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/ainur_narsil/blob/master/service.sh)  More correct would be say that Ainur Narsil removes all audio fx, and Tinymix on top of it allows modify some system audio settings, in such way extending its functionality without lowering audio quality. So we have not only system level audio settings unobstructed, but also can further improve them, which is not possible by any other means. Installing other popular audio mods here is not solution, for it brings us back to the point from where we have started, to pcm 16 bit audio format. I have tested many audio players and most of Magisk audio mods with Flingerdamp.apk, and have found that where ever we enable them or equalizers built into media player, the sound becomes encoded into pcm 16bit. That is law. That is why, I use simplest media player, without equalizer or any other tweaks, which is one built into Mixplorer, and which allows to listen music file as it is, without re-compression. 
## Qualcomm Audio 
[Qualcomm Audio](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/internet-of-things/consumer/audio)  [(link 2)](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/internet-of-things/consumer/audio/mobile-audio) is integrated into core of the Qualcomm processors, but its full potential usually not properly implemented by Android developers and manufacturers due various reasons, such as licensing, personal interests, the safety of equipment (i.e. speakers & headphones), as well as safety of ears (which also could cost). That is why, as I have found, for example the HD mode for head phones wasn't activated by default on my Redmi 7, or Hifi sound was not activated by default on my Pixel 3, even after installing Ainur Narsil. 
## Audio Modifications
On older versions of Android, we could relatively easily edit values of mixer_path.xml, in accordance with our demands, but the newer versions of android made this process much more difficult. I have spent lot of time trying to make my system partition r/w, and have to reinstall OS anew after this, but was not able to implement properly working solution on A12 stock+microg. And here Tinymix Manager comes to help. With the help of this program we can change different audio setting easily. The most changes would survive till the next reboot, while some tweaks we have to enable while listening music, such as for example 'enable compression of gapless playback on-off'. Also potentially and probably for now, using the combination of Ainur Narsil+Tinymix, we can change those values permanently. This function is not tested much by me yet, but I will describe how to test and use it below.
## What is Tinymix?
Tinymix and Tinyalsa are the audio implementing components of Linux OS, borrowed by android developers along with other inbuilt components of Linux. In older versions of Android, approximately up to A9, the tinymix binaries were included as mandatory, but later they were abolished as obsolete by developers, who went other way, and never bother to properly implement their functionality into AOS. Instead of implementing dynamic functions of tinymix, developers have chosen to replace its function by static mixer_path.xml. Despite this sad fact, tinymix is still remains functional, but requires tinymix binaries along with GUI to function properly. And so far, it is the only working solution among many tasted by me, to modify mixer path values without actually modifying it.
## Requirements
I have tasted Tinymix Manager on Android 9-10, Lineage OS Microg  edition  Redmi7 and Stock A12 with Microg on Pixel 3. In both causes it was working properly. Both these rooms have signature spoofing enabled, but I do not think it requires for it to work properly. Magisk versions 20 to 27. And in cause if you decide to go for Magisk Module installation of the Tinymix Manager as the system program, it is desirable to have custom recovery installed in cause of any problems.
## Implementation:
There are tree possible installations of Tinymix: first original apk with less permissions. This version available in three formats: arm7, arm8 and x86. Second is modified by me apk, which is only for arm8. My mod has more audio and system related permissions (I only edited manifest.xml). Note: the both above mentioned apks are very primitive, and have only functionality related to tinymix.bin and audio flinger (built in). They didn't have internet access on any level. The third possible implementation is to install Tinymix Manager as system app via provided by me Magisk module, in cause if you were not satisfied with both above mentioned solutions. I personally use this method, actually I have assembled this module for myself.
